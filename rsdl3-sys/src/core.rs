Recording devices will feed any bound audio streams\n with a copy of any incoming data.\n\n An opened audio device starts out with no audio streams bound. To start\n audio playing, bind a stream and supply audio data to it. Unlike SDL2,\n there is no audio callback; you only bind audio streams and make sure they\n have data flowing into them (however, you can simulate SDL2's semantics\n fairly closely by using SDL_OpenAudioDeviceStream instead of this\n function).\n\n If you don't care about opening a specific device, pass a `devid` of either\n `SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK` or\n `SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING`. In this case, SDL will try to pick\n the most reasonable default, and may also switch between physical devices\n seamlessly later, if the most reasonable default changes during the\n lifetime of this opened device (user changed the default in the OS's system\n preferences, the default got unplugged so the system jumped to a new\n default, the user plugged in headphones on a mobile device, etc). Unless\n you have a good reason to choose a specific device, this is probably what\n you want.\n\n You may request a specific format for the audio device, but there is no\n promise the device will honor that request for several reasons. As such,\n it's only meant to be a hint as to what data your app will provide. Audio\n streams will accept data in whatever format you specify and manage\n conversion for you as appropriate. SDL_GetAudioDeviceFormat can tell you\n the preferred format for the device before opening and the actual format\n the device is using after opening.\n\n It's legal to open the same device ID more than once; each successful open\n will generate a new logical SDL_AudioDeviceID that is managed separately\n from others on the same physical device. This allows libraries to open a\n device separately from the main app and bind its own streams without\n conflicting.\n\n It is also legal to open a device ID returned by a previous call to this\n function; doing so just creates another logical device on the same physical\n device. This may be useful for making logical groupings of audio streams.\n\n This function returns the opened device ID on success. This is a new,\n unique SDL_AudioDeviceID that represents a logical device.\n\n Some backends might offer arbitrary devices (for example, a networked audio\n protocol that can connect to an arbitrary server).

Most backends don't offer anything like this, and often\n this would be an end user setting an environment variable for their custom\n need, and not something an application should specifically manage.\n\n When done with an audio device, possibly at the end of the app's life, one\n should call SDL_CloseAudioDevice() on the returned device id.\n\n \\param devid the device instance id to open, or\n              SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK or\n              SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING for the most reasonable\n              default device.\n \\param spec the requested device configuration.

#[doc = " Pixel format.\n\n SDL's pixel formats have the following naming convention:\n\n - Names with a list of components and a single bit count, such as RGB24 and\n   ABGR32, define a platform-independent encoding into bytes in the order\n   specified. For example, in RGB24 data, each pixel is encoded in 3 bytes\n   (red, green, blue) in that order, and in ABGR32 data, each pixel is\n   encoded in 4 bytes alpha, blue, green, red) in that order. Use these\n   names if the property of a format that is important to you is the order\n   of the bytes in memory or on disk.\n - Names with a bit count per component, such as ARGB8888 and XRGB1555, are\n   \"packed\" into an appropriately-sized integer in the platform's native\n   endianness. For example, ARGB8888 is a sequence of 32-bit integers; in\n   each integer, the most significant bits are alpha, and the least\n   significant bits are blue. On a little-endian CPU such as x86, the least\n   significant bits of each integer are arranged first in memory, but on a\n   big-endian CPU such as s390x, the most significant bits are arranged\n   first. Use these names if the property of a format that is important to\n   you is the meaning of each bit position within a native-endianness\n   integer.\n - In indexed formats such as INDEX4LSB, each pixel is represented by\n   encoding an index into the palette into the indicated number of bits,\n   with multiple pixels packed into each byte if appropriate. In LSB\n   formats, the first (leftmost) pixel is stored in the least-significant\n   bits of the byte; in MSB formats, it's stored in the most-significant\n   bits. INDEX8 does not need LSB/MSB variants, because each pixel exactly\n   fills one byte.\n\n The 32-bit byte-array encodings such as RGBA32 are aliases for the\n appropriate 8888 encoding for the current platform. For example, RGBA32 is\n an alias for ABGR8888 on little-endian CPUs like x86, or an alias for\n RGBA8888 on big-endian CPUs.\n\n \\since This enum is available since SDL 3.2.0."]

If you code carefully, you can handle\n these quirks without any platform-specific code, though:\n\n - On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;\n   this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current\n   before calling SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(). If you recreate your context or\n   create a second context, you should assume that any existing function\n   pointers aren't valid to use with it. This is (currently) a\n   Windows-specific limitation, and in practice lots of drivers don't suffer\n   this limitation, but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to\n   work and you should expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy\n   of the function pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.\n - On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any\n   context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all.\n   This means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you\n   look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that\n   is _NOT_ safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually\n   available for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the\n   existence of the appropriate extension with SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(),\n   or verifying that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function\n   as core functionality.\n - Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, *will* return NULL if a function\n   isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for\n   extensions you use, and if you get a NULL anyway, act as if that\n   extension wasn't available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you\n   can code defensively for this scenario anyhow.\n - Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.\n   Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not\n   make the same promises about function pointers.\n - OpenGL function pointers must be declared `APIENTRY` as in the example\n   code.

#[doc = " Structure that represents a haptic direction.\n\n This is the direction where the force comes from, instead of the direction\n in which the force is exerted.\n\n Directions can be specified by:\n\n - SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR : Specified by polar coordinates.\n - SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN : Specified by cartesian coordinates.\n - SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL : Specified by spherical coordinates.\n\n Cardinal directions of the haptic device are relative to the positioning of\n the device. North is considered to be away from the user.\n\n The following diagram represents the cardinal directions:\n\n ```\n                .--.\n                |__| .-------.\n                |=.| |.-----.|\n                |--| ||     ||\n                |  | |'-----'|\n                |__|~')_____('\n                  [ COMPUTER ]\n\n\n                    North (0,-1)\n                        ^\n                        |\n                        |\n  (-1,0)  West <----[ HAPTIC ]----> East (1,0)\n                        |\n                        |\n                        v\n                     South (0,1)\n\n\n                     [ USER ]\n                       \\|||/\n                       (o o)\n                 ---ooO-(_)-Ooo---\n ```\n\n If type is SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR, direction is encoded by hundredths of a degree\n starting north and turning clockwise. SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR only uses the first\n `dir` parameter. The cardinal directions would be:\n\n - North: 0 (0 degrees)\n - East: 9000 (90 degrees)\n - South: 18000 (180 degrees)\n - West: 27000 (270 degrees)\n\n If type is SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN, direction is encoded by three positions (X\n axis, Y axis and Z axis (with 3 axes)). SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN uses the first\n three `dir` parameters. The cardinal directions would be:\n\n - North: 0,-1, 0\n - East: 1, 0, 0\n - South: 0, 1, 0\n - West: -1, 0, 0\n\n The Z axis represents the height of the effect if supported, otherwise it's\n unused. In cartesian encoding (1, 2) would be the same as (2, 4), you can\n use any multiple you want, only the direction matters.\n\n If type is SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL, direction is encoded by two rotations. The\n first two `dir` parameters are used. The `dir` parameters are as follows\n (all values are in hundredths of degrees):\n\n - Degrees from (1, 0) rotated towards (0, 1).\n - Degrees towards (0, 0, 1) (device needs at least 3 axes).\n\n Example of force coming from the south with all encodings (force coming\n from the south means the user will have to pull the stick to counteract):\n\n ```c\n  SDL_HapticDirection direction;\n\n  // Cartesian directions\n  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN; // Using cartesian direction encoding.\n  direction.dir[0] = 0; // X position\n  direction.dir[1] = 1; // Y position\n  // Assuming the device has 2 axes, we don't need to specify third parameter.\n\n  // Polar directions\n  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR; // We'll be using polar direction encoding.\n  direction.dir[0] = 18000; // Polar only uses first parameter\n\n  // Spherical coordinates\n  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL; // Spherical encoding\n  direction.dir[0] = 9000; // Since we only have two axes we don't need more parameters.\n ```\n\n \\since This struct is available since SDL 3.2.0.\n\n \\sa SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR\n \\sa SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN\n \\sa SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL\n \\sa SDL_HAPTIC_STEERING_AXIS\n \\sa SDL_HapticEffect\n \\sa SDL_GetNumHapticAxes"]
